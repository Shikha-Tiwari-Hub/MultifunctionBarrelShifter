## Multifunction barrel shifter 
Consider an 8-bit shifting circuit that can perform rotating right or rotating left. An addi- 
tional I-bit control signal, lr, specifies the desired direction. 
1. Design the circuit using one rotate-right circuit, one rotate-left circuit, and one 2-to-1 
multiplexer to select the desired result. Derive the code. 
2. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code.
